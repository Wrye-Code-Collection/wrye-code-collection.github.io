### Official Wrye Bash site

If you are looking for the official supported Wrye Bash website for Oblivion, Skyrim, Skyrim SE, and Fallout 4 that project is [located here](https://github.com/wrye-bash/wrye-bash).

## Welcome to my collection of Wrye Mash/Flash/Bash Code

### Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas

Valda was kind enough to give me authoritative access to both his Wrye Flash for Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas. The versions are for the most part as Valda left them. On occasion, when reported, minor changes are made to the record definitions. Other then that they are not maintained.  You can find them at the links below.

### Wrye Mash for Morrowind

I had asked Wrye if I could update Wrye mash a few years back but never really started doing any owrk on it until recenty. I have resolved a few bugs, updated some of the code to more fully support unicode, and made sure you can still compile it into a standalone exe file.  

There are two options for download, the Python Code and a Standalone EXE.  The python code will always be up to date with any of the current changes but requires Python 2.7.12 or higher installed as well as a few other components. The standalone EXE offered will usually be the last stable build. As changes are made if it is determined another stable build can be released you will find it in the releases section of the Wrye Mash repository.

The Wrye mash documentation will be available online soon after I make some changes.
