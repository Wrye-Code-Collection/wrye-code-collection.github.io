<p>Valda was kind enough to give me authoritative access to his versions of Wrye Flash for Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas. The versions are for the most part as Valda left them. On occasion, when reported, minor changes are made to the record definitions. Recently I updated Wrye Flash for Fallout New Vegas to include JIP Version 51.60.  Other then that they are not maintained.  You can find them at the links below.</p>

<p>I had asked Wrye if I could update Wrye mash a few years back but never really started doing any work on it until recently. I have resolved a few bugs, updated some of the code to more fully support Unicode, and made sure you can still compile it into a standalone exe file.</p>
<p class="empty">&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two options for download, the Python Code and a Standalone EXE.  The python code will always be up to date with any of the current changes but requires Python 2.7.12 or higher installed as well as a few other components. The standalone EXE offered will usually be the last stable build. As changes are made if it is determined another stable build can be released you will find it in the releases section of the Wrye Mash repository.</p>
